Goal: Help me make a ranked list of a collection of random items
Algorithm:
	- Have a dictionary with as key a random item and as value 0
	- Pick two random keys from dictionary
	- Print them out for user
	- Have user input choose between them
	- If user chose an item, add +1 to item
	- If user didn't choose an item, add -1 to item
	- Loop until user input = done
	- If done, print dictionary ordered by value of values.

Helpers:
	- pickRandomKeys: input: dictionary, output: two random keys in dictionary
	- getOrderedListFromDict: returns an ordered list from dictionary
